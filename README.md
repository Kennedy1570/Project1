# PROJECT TITLE - Dice Game Simulator
This is a game that simulates rolling two dice however many times the user chooses to roll.
Generates random numbers from each roll and tells you how many times a certain number was rolled from 2-12.
I am trying to get familiar with C++; this is my first real attempt at a coding project in C++.
Standard code style.
Built with VS Code IDE.
